Welcome to django-easycart's documentation!
===========================================

Easycart is a flexible session-based shopping cart application for Django.
It provides plenty of hooks for overriding and extending the way it works.

By installing this app you get:

* Highly-customizable :class:`~cart.BaseCart` and :class:`~cart.BaseItem`
  classes to represent the user cart and items in it.

* A handy set of reusable components (views, urls and a context processor) for
  the most common tasks. These components are completely optional.

**Requirements**: Python 3.4+ Django 1.8+
